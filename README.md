# Play Away 

Play Away will be an app designed to allow someone to buy games online. We will be putting power in the hands of the user for a smoother and easier process to game purchasing, without cutting corners. The app gives customers the power to order games, manage a shopping cart, and view receipts and invoices. This app also allows employees to add or remove items or images and edit items details. While the manager can add or remove employees, check sales, manage inventory and mantain customers and promotional codes. 

## Detailed Description 

Play Away is a central hub for customer and employees alike. After making an account, customers can use the app to purchase games. They will have a way of viewing the product information as well as to choose quantity and console. After clicking the order button, the product will be sent to the customer's cart and will have the ability to keep shopping,finalize purchase, or view receipts and invoices. While employees can use the app to add products, track sales data and make product changes, managers will have the same abilities of an employee with the added benefit of being able maintain customers, employees and promotional codes.

The Scope of the project is to put the power of physically being in a store right into the hands of the customers and employees. By allowing this access everywhere, we hope to make game shopping easily accessible for our customers and make things easier on our employees with the added benefit of a possible increase in sales. 

The biggest limitation of the project is that I will be working on this completely by myself. I am also limiting the amount of features that are present due to time constraint. 

### Inventory and Inventory Control

The products are going to be different versions of a game for different game consoles. The quantity will be determined by number of same games in stock. 

The customer will be able to purchase a game out of the available choices and console types.
